Hello,

I'm a software developer from Strasbourg, France.
I'm currently working as project manager for a french company specialized in security systems and remote monitoring.
During my spare time, I'm a technology enthusiast and I like discovering new languages and technologies to develop personal projects.

I also hold a PhD in Computer Networks from the University of Strasbourg, France.
My research interest was about Wireless Sensor Networks which are composed of small
autonomous embedded devices which cooperate to monitor their environment in a less
intrusive fashion. I focused on mobility management to allow sensor nodes to be
placed on mobile elements and continue to send data to neighbor networks in an
energy efficient way.

This website is my little personal space on Internet.
I built it using [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
It doubles as my resume ([publications]({{'/publications/' | relative_url }})) and a place to post guides, code fragments and anything that I find interesting.
