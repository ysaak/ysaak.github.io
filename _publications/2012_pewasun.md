Defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force, the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
Area Networks (6LoWPAN) standard allows heavily constrained devices (such as wireless
sensors) to connect to IPv6 networks. This is an important step towards the Internet of
Things, in which connected devices will be present anywhere. Due to the pervasive nature
of IP networks, mobile sensors would connect to various IPv6 networks. Layer 3 mobility
is commonly managed by the Mobile IPv6 protocol. However, this protocol is categorized
as too complex in the literature for heavily constrained devices because it involves
mobile devices in the mobility management operations. Such conclusions are based on
simulations or experimentations in which several aspects of the protocol remain
insufficiently detailed nor evaluated. In this article, we propose a complete evaluation
of Mobile IPv6 over 6LoWPAN networks. For this, we have implemented Mobile IPv6 in
Contiki and have performed intensive experimentations on a real testbed. The results
highlight that Mobile IPv6 can be used on 6LoWPAN with a reduced impact on delay and
throughput thanks to the existing compression mechanisms. But they also point out the
ineffectiveness of the movement detection used by Mobile IPv6.
