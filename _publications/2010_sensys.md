In this paper, we briefly describe an interactive roulette game enabled over a wireless
sensor network platform. It basically consists in a train speeding in one way (the
spinning roulette) and in a message hopping along some deployed sensors in the other way
(the wheeling ball). This demonstration aims at illustrating in an interactive manner
the high radio channel randomness in dense wireless sensor networks, as well as its
impact on the communication protocols.
