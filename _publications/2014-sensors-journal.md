The last decade saw the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, which aims
to connect any object to the Internet. As in IoT networks, the radio component is
usually the main source of energy depletion, specific medium access control protocols
have been designed to reduce its usage. Among those, X-MAC has gained much interest in
recent years, and has become one of the most popular MAC protocols in the IoT community
due to its many theoretical advantages. X-MAC is a preamble-sampling protocol based on
the low power listening mechanism, in which the nodes decide their schedule
independently from their neighbors. So far, no study has ever identified malfunctions
that appear in the protocol design. In addition, performance evaluations were only made
through theoretical studies and simulations, or relatively limited scale experiments.
In this paper, we point out several omissions and black spots that appear in the
original protocol design and that lead to encountering severe underachievements. We
also provide explanations to these flaws and propose solutions that solve or at least
reduce their impact. Finally, we have led a thorough experimental campaign on an indoor
static grid composed of 240 nodes. From those studies, we quantify the performances of
the original X-MAC design and the impact of our improvements.
